# turingmachine.clj
A simple way to simulate (deterministic) turingmachines using clojure!

> Note that I would like to make use of the "gÃ¶del number" in the future. This is just a simple implementation.

# Definition: Turingmachine
A turingmachine is defined by the following septuple:

TM = $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, \square, F)$
where
- $Q$ = finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ = input symbols/alphabet
- $\Gamma$ = tape symbols/alphabet
- $\delta$ = a set of state transitions in the form of $(state_{now}, reads) = (state_{after}, writes, direction)$
- $q_0$ = initial state with $q_0 \in Q$
- $\square$ = the "blank" symbol
- $F$ = the set of accepted states

The Turing machine is equipped with a tape that can be extended in both directions without limit. It is also necessary to note that the machine is only permitted to advance a single step in either direction.

For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the following Turing machine:

![](./imgs/tm_example1.png)

This turingmachine only accepts words/inputs which are atleast 1 character long and start with 0 or 1 (ignores the blanks at the beginning).
All accepted states are usually circled twice. In this example we have only one accepted state, which is $q_2$.
$q_1$ on the other hand is the initial state which means:

$$ Q = \set{q_1, q_2} $$

$$ F = \set{q_2} $$

Since our input words only consist of 0, 1 and _ (blank) and we are only writing 0, 1 or _ (blank) to the tape we define...

$$ \Sigma = \set{0, 1, \\_} $$

$$ \Gamma = \set{0, 1, \\_} $$

$$ \square = \\_ $$

We may now consider the state transitions. To begin with, we shall examine $q_1$.

The notation $0:1,R$ represents a transition in which the system reads 0, writes 1, and then moves to the right on the tape. Given that the initial state is $q_1$ and the final state is $q_2$, this transition can be expressed as follows: $(q_1, 0) = (q_2, 1, R)$.
This approach can be applied to all transitions, and the resulting expressions can be summarized as follows:
- $\delta_1(q_1, \\_) = (q_1, \\_, R)$
- $\delta_2(q_1, 0) = (q_2, 1, R)$
- $\delta_3(q_1, 1) = (q_2, 0, R)$
- $\delta_4(q_2, 0) = (q_2, 1, R)$
- $\delta_5(q_2, 1) = (q_2, 0, R)$

We have successfully configured a Turing machine and read a Turing machine visualization.

# Examples
> You can find some examples [here](./tuma/test/tuma/examples.clj).

The following example illustrates the process of adding one to a binary number using a Turing machine.
```clojure
(ns tuma.core
  (:require [tuma.turingmachine :as tm]
            [tuma.transition :as trans]))

(defn -main []
  ; turingmachine that adds one to a binary number and traces the transitions
  (let [t1 (trans/new-transition :q1 "1" :q1 "1" :right)
        t2 (trans/new-transition :q1 "0" :q1 "0" :right)
        t3 (trans/new-transition :q1 "_" :q3 "_" :left)
        t4 (trans/new-transition :q3 "1" :q3 "0" :left)
        t5 (trans/new-transition :q3 "0" :q2 "1" :left)
        transitions [t1 t2 t3 t4 t5]
        states [:q1 :q2 :q3]
        input-symbols ["0" "1"]
        tape-symbols ["0" "1" "_"]
        accepted-states [:q2]
        tm (tm/new-turingmachine states input-symbols tape-symbols transitions :q1 "_" accepted-states)
        input "10011"
        result (tm/emulate-tm tm input true)]
    (println result)))
```
One may either invoke the `emulate-tm` function with three parameters (turingmachine, input trace?) or with two parameters (turingmachine, input). This allows the user to specify whether or not they wish to have the transitions printed out. In the event that they do not wish to utilise this functionality, it is possible to simply omit the `trace?` parameter.

In the aforementioned example, the value of the 'trace?' parameter was set to 'true', resulting in the following output on the terminal:
```clj
source: :q1 reads: 1 destination: :q1 writes: 1 direction: :right
source: :q1 reads: 0 destination: :q1 writes: 0 direction: :right
source: :q1 reads: 0 destination: :q1 writes: 0 direction: :right
source: :q1 reads: 1 destination: :q1 writes: 1 direction: :right
source: :q1 reads: 1 destination: :q1 writes: 1 direction: :right
source: :q1 reads: _ destination: :q3 writes: _ direction: :left
source: :q3 reads: 1 destination: :q3 writes: 0 direction: :left
source: :q3 reads: 1 destination: :q3 writes: 0 direction: :left
source: :q3 reads: 0 destination: :q2 writes: 1 direction: :left
{:input 10011, :output 10100_, :end-state :q2, :verdict :accepted}
```
